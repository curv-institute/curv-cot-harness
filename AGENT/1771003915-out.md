**Corruption:** K=30 (all items), 3 independent seeds
**Targets:** opus, sonnet_tgt, haiku

## Per-Seed Results

### Seed 1

| Condition | Agreement | Avg Accuracy | AoW | Plurality-Wrong |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-----|-----------------|
| No trace | 0.044 | 0.089 | 0 | 27 |
| Uncorrupted | 0.022 | 0.156 | 0 | 26 |
| Corrupted | 0.056 | 0.133 | 0 | 26 |

Follow events: 4 (opus: 13.3%, sonnet_tgt: 0%, haiku: 0%)

### Seed 2

| Condition | Agreement | Avg Accuracy | AoW | Plurality-Wrong |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-----|-----------------|
| No trace | 0.000 | 0.067 | 0 | 27 |
| Uncorrupted | 0.011 | 0.144 | 0 | 27 |
| Corrupted | 0.056 | 0.133 | 0 | 25 |

Follow events: 2 (opus: 0%, sonnet_tgt: 0%, haiku: 6.7%)

### Seed 3

| Condition | Agreement | Avg Accuracy | AoW | Plurality-Wrong |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-----|-----------------|
| No trace | 0.011 | 0.067 | 0 | 27 |
| Uncorrupted | 0.011 | 0.144 | 0 | 27 |
| Corrupted | 0.067 | 0.144 | **1** | 26 |

Follow events: 4 (opus: 10%, sonnet_tgt: 3.3%, haiku: 0%)

## Aggregate Replication

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AoW per seed | [0, 0, 1] |
| AoW mean | 0.33 |
| AoW std | 0.47 |
| Total follow events | 10 |
| Total plurality-wrong (corrupted) | 77 |
| Total plurality-wrong (no trace) | 81 |

## Answers

1. **Does agreement-on-wrong replicate across seeds?**
   **No.** Only 1/3 seeds showed AoW (seed 3). Not replicated.

2. **Does corruption-follow scale when K=30?**
   **Marginal.** 10 follow events across 270 corrupted item-model pairs (3.7%), close to random baseline.

3. **Does plurality-wrong emerge under amplified corruption?**
   **No.** Plurality-wrong actually decreased from 81 (no trace) to 77 (corrupted). High plurality-wrong reflects task difficulty, not corruption effects.

4. **Which target is most sensitive to corruption?**
   **Opus** (mean follow rate 7.8%), followed by haiku (2.2%), then sonnet_tgt (1.1%).

## Conclusion

The single AoW from Experiment 005 does not replicate under amplified corruption. The causal AoW appears to be statistical noise rather than a scalable collapse vulnerability. Per stop condition: no harmonization/selection layers required.
