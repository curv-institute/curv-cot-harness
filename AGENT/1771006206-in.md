# Agent Prompt — Run Experiment 007 (Adversarial Static Trace Stress Test)

## Objective

Test whether static trace injection induces agreement-on-wrong or plurality collapse under deliberately adversarial task construction. Changes only dataset distribution.

## Axis

task adversariality: natural semantic ambiguity (Exp 005) -> adversarial trap-structured tasks

## Models

- Proposer: Claude Sonnet 4.5
- Targets: Claude Opus 4.5, Sonnet 4.5 (target), Haiku

## Dataset

eval/datasets/exp007_adversarial.jsonl (N=60)
Each item: id, prompt, answer, plausible_wrong
Adversarial categories: plausible-wrong dominant explanation, salience trap, causal inversion, normative framing

## Conditions

1. No trace
2. Uncorrupted proposer trace
3. Corrupted adversarial trace (steers toward plausible_wrong)

## Corruption

K=30 (half), selected via sha256(id) lowest 30
Operator steers toward plausible_wrong, single incorrect assumption, fluent

## Run Name

v0.1.6-adversarial-static-trace-20260213

## Metrics

Pairwise agreement, AoC, AoW, plurality consensus/wrong, per-target accuracy, transfer gain
Adversarial: trap-follow rate, trap-consensus rate, disagreement suppression

## Stop Condition

Stop after push. If AoW or plurality-wrong >5% absolute increase over baseline, escalation to Exp 008 justified.
