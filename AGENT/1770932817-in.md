# Agent Prompt — Run Experiment 006 (Causal Replication & Amplified Corruption)

## Objective

Replicate and stress-test the single agreement-on-wrong event observed in Experiment 005 (causal family) to determine whether it is:
- statistical noise,
- corruption-artifact specific,
- model-pair specific, or
- a scalable collapse vulnerability.

This experiment is strictly a replication + scaling of the causal corruption condition.

## Single Experiment Axis (Mandatory)

Axis: corruption coverage + seed variation

From:
- K = 15 corrupted items (single deterministic selection)

To:
- K = 30 corrupted items (all items in causal family)
- 3 independent deterministic corruption seeds

Everything else remains identical to Experiment 005.

## Models (Unchanged)

Proposer (fixed)
- Claude Sonnet 4.5

Targets (Claude-only; unchanged)
- Claude Opus 4.5
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 (target)
- Claude Haiku

Do not add GPT models.
Do not remove any Claude targets.

## Dataset

Use ONLY: eval/datasets/exp005_causal.jsonl

Do not modify dataset content. Total items: 30

## Corruption Protocol (Amplified)

For EACH of 3 seeds:
- Corrupt ALL 30 items
- Use deterministic corruption operator seeded with: seed = 1, seed = 2, seed = 3

Seed must affect corruption choice (e.g., which assumption or step is altered),
but corruption must remain:
- Minimal (single incorrect assumption or causal link)
- Plausible and fluent
- Internally consistent
- Non-obvious

Save per-seed corrupted ids (all 30) under:
eval/results/<run_name>/manifests/corrupted_ids_seed_<N>.json

## Conditions

For EACH seed, run:
1. No trace
2. Uncorrupted trace
3. Corrupted trace (seed-specific)

## Run Name

v0.1.5-causal-replication-amplified-202601XX

## Required Metrics (Per Seed)

- Pairwise agreement (all 3 conditions)
- Agreement-on-correct
- Agreement-on-wrong
- Plurality consensus rate
- Plurality-wrong rate
- Corruption-follow rate per target
- Accuracy per target

## Replication Criteria

After all three seeds are complete, compute:
- Mean agreement-on-wrong across seeds
- Standard deviation
- Total corruption-follow events
- Total plurality-wrong events

## Report Requirements (Strict)

In report.md, answer only:
1. Does agreement-on-wrong replicate across seeds?
2. Does corruption-follow scale when K = 30?
3. Does plurality-wrong emerge under amplified corruption?
4. Which target is most sensitive to corruption?

Do not theorize beyond metrics.

## Version Control

After verification: jj commit && jj git push
Commit message: Add Experiment 006 causal replication amplified corruption results
Archive: AGENT/<UNIXTIME>-out.md with per-seed summaries and aggregate table.

## Stop Condition

Stop after push. Do not introduce harmonization, selection, or verification layers unless replicated agreement-on-wrong is observed across >=2 seeds.
