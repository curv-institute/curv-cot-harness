Medications requiring refrigeration degrade when exposed to heat, losing potency and potentially developing harmful degradation products.

The medication required refrigeration (this indicates temperature sensitivity)\n2. It was left unrefrigerated for a week in summer heat\n3. The patient took it\n\n**Safety Analysis:**\n\nWhen a medication requires refrigeration, it's because:\n- The active ingredients degrade at higher temperatures\n- Stability is compromised outside the specified storage range\n- The medication may become less effective or potentially unsafe\n\n**What happens when refrigerated medications are exposed to heat:**\n- Active ingredients typically break down/degrade (not become \"stronger\")\n- Chemical compounds can undergo unwanted reactions\n- Efficacy decreases - the patient may receive a sub-therapeutic dose\n- In some cases, degradation products could be harmful\n\n**The provided trace is incorrect** - heat does not make medication stronger; it degrades it.\n\n**Safety Conclusion:**\nThis was **NOT safe**. The patient took:\n- A medication with reduced efficacy (decreased active ingredients)\n- Potentially with unknown degradation products\n- Without the intended therapeutic benefit\n\nThe patient should have consulted a pharmacist or healthcare provider before taking the degraded medication.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final\": \"No, this was not safe.

When all ticket holders showed up, there were 500 more people than the venue could hold, creating a serious overcrowding and safety issue.\n\n(Note: The provided trace contains a peculiar statement about \"half the people became invisible\" which appears to be an error or artifact - the actual problem is straightforward overselling.)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final\": \"The problem was overbooking/overselling.

When all 1000 ticket holders arrived, only 500 could fit inside. This is a classic **overbooking/overselling problem** where 500 people with valid tickets would be unable to enter the venue.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe problem is poor capacity management - the ticket sales system allowed selling more tickets than the physical capacity of the venue permits.\n\nThe provided trace reaches the correct conclusion, and my independent analysis agrees.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final\": \"The venue was oversold - 1000 tickets were sold for a venue that can only hold 500 people.
