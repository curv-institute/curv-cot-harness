Both actions taken by the company—eliminating advertising and raising prices—are counterproductive when facing declining sales:\n\n1. **Cutting advertising to zero** removes a key driver of customer acquisition and brand awareness, directly reducing the sales pipeline.\n\n2. **Raising prices** decreases demand through basic economics, making the product less accessible to price-sensitive customers who may switch to competitors.\n\nThese decisions compound the initial sales decline rather than reverse it.
