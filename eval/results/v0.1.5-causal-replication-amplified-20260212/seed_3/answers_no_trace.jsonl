However, this sounds like it could be referring to a famous sports story. Based on the clues provided (team that never practiced together, didn't know each other's positions, played against champions), this is likely referring to the 1980 \"Miracle on Ice\" where the U.S. Olympic hockey team defeated the Soviet Union.\n\nHowever, without being able to search for verification, I can provide my best educated response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final\": \"The team won/defeated the champions.
