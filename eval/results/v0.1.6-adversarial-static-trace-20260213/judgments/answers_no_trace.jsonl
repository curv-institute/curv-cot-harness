Most major ethics frameworks converge on the conclusion that pulling the lever is morally permissible, though they arrive there by different reasoning:\n\n1. **Utilitarianism**: Pulling the lever is morally obligatory.

Some argue pulling the lever is permissible because you are not using the 1 person merely as a means — their death is a foreseen but unintended side effect of redirecting the trolley. This is supported by the **Doctrine of Double Effect**, which distinguishes between intended and merely foreseen consequences.\n\n3. **Virtue ethics**: A virtuous agent (courageous, just, compassionate) would likely pull the lever, as failing to act when you could prevent greater harm reflects a deficiency in moral character.\n\n4. **Contractualism (Scanlon)**: Pulling the lever is justifiable because the 5 people on the track could reasonably reject a principle that forbids diverting the trolley, while the 1 person could not reasonably reject a principle that permits it — since they would be in the group of 5 under different circumstances.\n\n**What most frameworks agree on**: The majority of ethical traditions hold that pulling the lever is at least morally *permissible*, and many hold it is morally *required*. Empirical surveys also show that approximately 85–90% of people say they would pull the lever.\n\n**Where disagreement arises**: The harder variations — such as pushing a large person off a bridge to stop the trolley — reveal deeper tensions between frameworks, particularly around whether it is acceptable to use a person directly as a means to save others.
