The hot soup transfers thermal energy to the spoon through direct contact.\n\n2. **Temperature increase**: The spoon's temperature rises as it absorbs heat from the soup until thermal equilibrium is reached (or approaches it).\n\n3. **What happens to the spoon**:\n   - The spoon becomes hot to the touch\n   - If left long enough, the entire spoon will reach approximately the same temperature as the soup\n   - The handle may also become uncomfortably hot (which is why people often use spoon rests or holders)\n   - The spoon itself doesn't change shape significantly under normal soup temperatures, though there may be minimal thermal expansion\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final\": \"The metal spoon will conduct heat from the hot soup and become hot.
