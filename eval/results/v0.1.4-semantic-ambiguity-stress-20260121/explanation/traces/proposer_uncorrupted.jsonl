Ice and liquid water are both made of H2O molecules with the same molecular weight. The molecules themselves don't become lighter when water freezes.\n\nOption B: 'Ice is less dense than liquid water due to hydrogen bonding structure' - This is the correct scientific explanation. When water freezes, hydrogen bonds cause the water molecules to arrange in a hexagonal crystalline structure with more space between molecules compared to liquid water. This open structure means ice has a lower density (about 0.92 g/cm³) than liquid water (1.00 g/cm³). Since ice is less dense, it floats on water according to Archimedes' principle.\n\nOption C: 'Cold things always float' - This is incorrect as a general principle. Most substances become denser when they cool and freeze, causing the solid form to sink in the liquid form. Water is unusual in this regard.

Let me evaluate each option:\n\nOption A: 'Heat makes the kernels jump' - This describes the observable effect (kernels jumping) but doesn't explain the underlying mechanism of why they pop. It's a superficial observation, not a scientific explanation.\n\nOption B: 'Water inside the kernel turns to steam and pressure bursts the hull' - This describes a clear mechanism: popcorn kernels contain moisture (water), and when heated, this water converts to steam. Steam occupies much more volume than liquid water, creating pressure inside the sealed hull. When the pressure exceeds what the hull can contain, it bursts, causing the starch inside to expand and the popcorn to 'pop'. This is consistent with the physics of phase changes and pressure.\n\nOption C: 'The oils in popcorn explode when hot' - While popcorn kernels do contain some oils, oils don't explode simply from heating in this temperature range. This would require combustion or a chemical reaction that doesn't occur during normal popping.\n\nThe correct scientific explanation is option B. Popcorn kernels have a hard, moisture-sealed hull and contain water (about 13-14% moisture content). When heated to approximately 180°C (356°F), the water inside turns to steam, building pressure up to about 135 psi.
