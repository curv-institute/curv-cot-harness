Flavor perception is a combination of taste (detected by tongue) and smell (detected by olfactory receptors). When nasal passages are congested during a cold, airflow to the olfactory receptors is blocked, dramatically reducing smell perception. Since much of what we perceive as \"taste\" is actually smell, this causes food to taste bland.\n\n- **Option C** (viruses attack taste buds): While some viruses can affect taste buds, this is not the primary mechanism during a common cold.

Both effects reduce the battery's ability to deliver current—exactly when more power is needed for engine starting in winter. Option A is unscientific anthropomorphization, and Option C, while true about daylight hours, has no direct relevance to battery chemistry or performance."}

Anxiety doesn't increase cognitive capacity or intelligence. This is a false premise.\n\n**B) Moderate arousal optimizes alertness and focus (Yerkes-Dodson law)**\n- This is the scientifically supported explanation. The Yerkes-Dodson law describes an inverted-U relationship between arousal and performance\n- It explains the *mechanism*: moderate arousal enhances attention and focus, creating optimal conditions for performance\n- Too little arousal = low motivation; too much arousal = stress and impaired cognition\n- Moderate arousal hits the optimal point\n\n**C) Anxious people study more**\n- This is a behavioral correlation, not a mechanistic explanation\n- It doesn't explain *why* moderate anxiety helps performance\n- It's context-specific (assumes studying) and doesn't apply universally\n- Would also predict high anxiety improves performance, contradicting the observation\n\nThe provided trace correctly identifies that **B** is the best answer because it directly explains the psychological mechanism (the Yerkes-Dodson law) that accounts for the observed phenomenon of optimal performance at moderate arousal levels.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final\": \"B\"\n}\n```"}
