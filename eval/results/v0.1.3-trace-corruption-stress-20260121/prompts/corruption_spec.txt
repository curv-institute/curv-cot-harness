Corruption Specification
========================

Selection: K=15 items selected by sorting SHA256(item_id) ascending, taking first 15.

Corruption method:
1. Find first "= <number>" pattern in trace
2. Modify number by +1 or -1 (determined by SHA256(item_id)[0] % 2)
3. Modify final answer by same delta

Constraints:
- Deterministic given item_id
- Minimal change (single arithmetic error)
- Plausible (no obviously wrong text)
